# Felispy

A LISP interpreter written in C.

## Project

This is my implementation of a LISP interpreter following the book [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).

I did it back in 2017. I kept separate folder for each chapter, but decided to recreate it as a git repository with a commit per chapter instead.
